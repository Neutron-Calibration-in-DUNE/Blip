# üóÉÔ∏è **GETTING STARTED**
## **Docker Container**
The easiest way to run Blip is to grab the [docker container](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/infophysics/blip/general).

1. [ Local Setup ](#local)
2. [ Wilson Cluster Setup ](#wilson)

## **Local Setup**
First, you must install docker and start it up using the commands,
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```
Then, we can grab the blip container with the following:
```bash
docker pull infophysics/blip:latest
```

To run the image in interactive mode, issue the command
```bash
docker run blip
```

To run the image using the blip_display and gpus, there are various command line parameters that must be set,
```bash
docker run --it --gpus all -p 5006:5006 blip
```
where the *--gpus all* command tells docker to forward GPU access and *-p 5006:5006* port forwards the local 5006 port in the container to the local host 5006 port.  

To access the container with ssh support from the local host, do the following:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -e "USER_ID=$(id -u)" -e GROUP_ID="$(id -g)" \
      -v "$HOME/.ssh:/home/builder/.ssh:rw" \
      -v "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK:/ssh.socket" -e "SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/ssh.socket" \
      --gpus all -p 5006:5006 blip
```

## **Wilson Cluster Setup**
On the Wilson cluster, there exists some preinstalled software for [cloning and running containers](https://computing.fnal.gov/wilsoncluster/containers/).  To activate this software, run
```bash
module load apptainer
```
You'll then want to make sure that you point the image cache to a directory other than nashome, which has limited space.  This can be done by the following
```bash
export APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=/wclustre/my_project_dir/apptainer/.apptainer/cache
```
where *my_project_dir* is the desired cache location.  Once this is done, make a folder to store the blip image
```bash
cd /clustre/my_project_dir/
mkdir images
cd images
```
Then, clone the docker image
```bash
apptainer build blip.sif docker://infophysics/blip:latest
```

To run the image, simply do
```bash
apptainer run blip.sif
```
