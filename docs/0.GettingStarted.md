# üóÉÔ∏è **GETTING STARTED**

There are several ways to install/use Blip and the BlipDisplay.  The installation can be done locally, or on the Wilson Cluster, however the easiest approach is to simply download the associated docker container which is already configured to run Blip and the BlipDisplay.  This page will cover both approaches, starting with using docker.

1. [ Getting the Repository ](#get)
2. [ Setting Up Blip ](#setup)

## Getting the Repository

In the terminal, one can clone this repository by typing the command:

`git clone https://personal_username@github.com/Neutron-Calibration-in-DUNE/Blip.git`

This uses the HTTPS protocol. For environments (e.g. computing clusters) where one has to use the SSH protocol:

`git clone git@github.com:Neutron-Calibration-in-DUNE/Blip.git`

Anyone in the "Neutron-Calibration-in-DUNE" organization should be able to develop (push changes to the remote repository).

Please contact Nicholas Carrara or David Rivera about becoming involved in development before merging with the main branch.
