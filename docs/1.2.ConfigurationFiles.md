# ðŸ“œ **BLIP CONFIGURATION FILES**

There are several sections in the configuration file that are used to configure the ```blip``` program.  

## Module

There are several programs that will run different tasks such as; training a neural network, running a TDA or clustering algorithm, performing some analysis, etc.  Each of these tasks are specified by a *module_type* and a corresponding *module_mode*.  For example, to train a neural network one would set in the configuration file:
```yaml
# example module section
module:
  module_name:  'training_test'
  module_type:  'ml'            # ml, clustering, tda, analysis, ...
  module_mode:  'training'      # training, inference, parameter_scan, ...
  gpu:          True
  gpu_device:   0
```
