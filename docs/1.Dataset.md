# üóÉÔ∏è **DETAILS OF THE DATASET**

There are several different types of datasets that Arrakis will generate from both LArSoft and larnd-sim.  On the wire detector side (i.e. LArSoft), there are both one and two-dimensional datasets for the light and charge readout respectively, as well as a three-dimensional dataset for the energy depositions.  Each of these datasets contains a set of arrays which maintains the event format, i.e. the first index of each array corresponds to a single event.  Each event consists of some set of features (variables) which correspond to the light and charge readout from the event.  Depending on the dataset, there are also other arrays which may contain high-level truth information corresponding to each `point' in an event, as well as for the entire event.

## WirePlanePointCloud
This dataset describes the charge readout from a wire-based LArTPC.  Each event is broken up into the corresponding views in the detector, and has the corresponding set of low-level features,

| Feature | Type | Description |
| ------- | ---- | ----------- |
| channel | Int | Channel from a wire plane readout which corresponds to a single wire | 
| tdc | Int | Time to digital conversion (TDC) corresponding to the time tick of the channel signal |
| adc | Int | Analog to digital conversion (ADC) corresponding to the amplitude of the channel signal at time `tdc' |


| High-level features | Type | Description|
| ------- | ---- | ----------- |
| source | class | denotes the source of the primary interaction (e.g. beam, radiological, pns, etc.) |
| topology | class | topological descriptor of physics (e.g. blip, track, shower) |
| particle | class | the pdg code of the particle which caused the energy deposition |
| physics | class | high-level descriptor of physics processes (e.g. hip, mip, capture gamma, etc.) |
| unique_topology | cluster | unique identifier of individual topology instances |
| unique_particle | cluster | unique identifier of individual particle instances (i.e. track id) |
| unique_physics | cluster | unique identifier of individual physics instances |
| hit_mean | hit | the mean tdc value corresponding to the hit |
| hit_rms | hit | rms of the tdcs corresponding to the hit |
| hit_amplitude | hit | amplitude of the hit (units of electrons) |
| hit_charge | hit | integral of the hit (units of electrons) |
| track_begin | track_topology | hits corresponding to the beginning of tracks |
| track_end | track_topology | hits corresponding to the ends of tracks |
| vertex | track_topology | hits corresponding to interaction vertices |
