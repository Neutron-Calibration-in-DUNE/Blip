  # ---- variables ----
  # The following variables are enough to describe a general set of tasks.  In tasks involving
  # semantic segmentation or point clouds networks, there should be a distinction between 
  # 'positions' and 'features', the former of which defines the grid/point cloud geometry,
  # while the later refers to discriminating variables.

  # ---- normalization ----
  # Normalization parameters for positions and features.  Typically we want to normalize
  # input features depending on the type of task, or to unbias certain simulation parameters,
  # e.g. by normalizaing ADC over an event sample we remove the overall scale of the detector
  # response.

  # ---- clustering ----
  # Clustering parameters are used for creating cluster datasets, i.e. datasets where each
  # sample is a cluster, rather than an entire event. The current clustering method is DBSCAN, 
  # but this will likely change in the future to accomidate other approaches.  If cluster_class
  # is specified, then only types 'cluster_class:cluster_label' will be turned into cluster
  # datasets.  The 'cluster_variables' are the variables to be considered in the clustering.
